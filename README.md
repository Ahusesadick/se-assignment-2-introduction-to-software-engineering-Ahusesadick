Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):ANS Software engineering applies engineering principles to develop reliable software, involving the entire lifecycle from planning to maintenance. It differs from traditional programming by its systematic approach, team collaboration, and rigorous quality assurance. The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) guides the process, with phases like planning, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
 
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models: ANS Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
Ø  Planning:-> Define project goals, scope, resources, and timeline. Activities include feasibility analysis and project planning.
Ø  Requirements Analysis:-> Gather and analyze user and business requirements. Activities involve creating requirements specifications through interviews, surveys, and document analysis.
Ø  Design: Define the architecture and detailed design of the system. This phase includes high-level system design and detailed component design.
Ø  Implementation (Coding): Translate design into executable code. Activities include writing code, unit testing, and integration.
Ø  Testing: Verify that the software meets requirements and is free of defects. Activities encompass system testing, integration testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), and bug fixing.
Ø  Deployment: Release the software to users. This phase involves deployment planning, installation, training, and handing over documentation.
Ø  Maintenance: Provide ongoing support and enhancements. Activities include bug fixes, performance improvements, and adding new features.
 
Agile vs. Waterfall Models
Agile Model:
Ø  Iterative and Incremental: Development is divided into small, manageable increments with iterative cycles.
Ø  Flexibility: Changes can be made even in later stages, responding quickly to feedback.
Ø  Collaboration: Emphasizes close collaboration between cross-functional teams and continuous customer involvement.
Ø  Delivery: Regular delivery of functional software, often in sprints (short development cycles).
Waterfall Model:
Ø  Sequential: Each phase must be completed before the next begins, with little overlap between phases.
Ø  Rigid Structure: Changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed, making it less adaptable to changes.
Ø  Documentation: Emphasizes comprehensive documentation at each phase.
Ø  Delivery: Software is delivered as a complete package at the end of the development cycle, with less frequent interim releases.
 
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering: ANS Agile vs. Waterfall Models
 
Agile Model:
Ø  Approach: Iterative and incremental.
Ø  Flexibility: Highly adaptable to changes.

Ø  Delivery: Frequent, incremental releases.
Ø  Documentation: Minimal, focusing on working software.
Ø  Risk Management: Early and continuous risk mitigation.
 
Waterfall Model:
Ø  Approach: Linear and sequential.
Ø  Flexibility: Less adaptable to changes.
Ø  Team Collaboration: Independent phase-based work with less customer involvement.
Ø  Delivery: Complete product delivered at the end.
Ø  Documentation: Extensive and thorough at each phase.
Ø  Risk Management: Risks identified early, but issues can arise late.
Preferred Scenarios
Agile: When requirements are evolving, needing flexibility, quick adaptation, and continuous feedback.
Waterfall: When requirements are stable, the project has a clear scope, extensive documentation is needed, and a structured approach is preferred.
Requirements Engineering
 
Requirements Engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining software requirements. It includes:
Ø  Elicitation: Gathering requirements from stakeholders.
Ø  Analysis: Refining and ensuring requirements are feasible.
